Collatz sequence
The Collatz sequence (also known as the Collatz conjecture) starts with a random positive integer. The next number in the sequence is computed by

divide the number by two in case it is an even number
three times the number plus one.
The sequence is finished when the number equals one.

It is assumed that the sequence is always finite. However, it was never formally mathematically proven that this assumption is true.

Write a program that, for a given starting number, prints the Collatz sequence until it reaches 1.
